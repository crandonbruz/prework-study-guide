# <Prework Study Guide Website>

## Description
I wanted to create a study guide that would help myself and other students be prepared for the course work ahead. I build this to have an easy guide to information that will help students understand how to use the platforms. I learned easier solutions to perform the same functions and get the same results.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
